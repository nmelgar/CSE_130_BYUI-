# Algorithm Design
<hr>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<hr>
<p>This is a repository to organize and share the programs created while taking the course "CSE 130: Algorithm Design". <br>
All the code is created by me. Please do not copy the code to save time as a student, it is better to create it yourself.  <br>

## Repository Structure
---
Each folder has differenc activities, more relevants are mentioned. <br>
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- Week 1
    +-- guess number    (guess number algorithm)

+-- Week 2
    +-- authentication  (user authentication algorithm)

+-- Week 3
    +-- others          (different practice algorithms)
    +-- monopoly design (monopoly algorithm design file)

+-- Week 4
    +-- monopoly        (monopoly program)

+-- Week 5
    +-- others          (different practice algorithms)
    +-- advanced search (started w/pseudocode)

+-- Week 6
    +-- advanced search (advanced search algorithm)

+-- Week 7
    +-- others          (different practice algorithms)
    +-- sort design     (sort design, algorithm efficiency)

+-- Week 8
    +-- sort program    (sort algorithm, asserts)

+-- Week 9
    +-- others          (starting numerical sequence design)

+-- Week 10
    +-- program         (numerical sequence algorithm)

+-- Week 12
    +-- prime design    (prime numbers algorithm design)

+-- Week 13
    +-- prime numbers   (prime numbers algorithm)

+-- Week 14
    +-- others          (different practice algorithms)
    +-- final exam   

+-- README.md           (general info)
```
